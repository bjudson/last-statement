            Since the death penalty was reinstated in 1974, the State of Texas has executed {{ exec_total }} people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just before every execution, the State allows the prisoner to make a last statement, which is transcribed. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice publishes the final words of the executed <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html" title="Executed Offenders">on its website</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page shows one such statement made by a person whose execution anniversary is today (or, if that is not possible, the nearest applicable day).
