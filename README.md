## Last Statement

This is a site which scrapes the last statements of people executed by the State of Texas from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website.

On the [front page](http://laststatement.org/), it shows a grid of 16 common sentiments found in the statements (e.g. Apologized to victimâ€™s family, Admitted guilt, Proclaimed innocence). By clicking sentiments, you can filter and view matching statements.

It also powers a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/LastStatementTx) which posts excerpts from the statements on the anniversary of the execution (up to four per day). An [RSS feed](http://laststatement.org/rss/statements) publishes entire statements as they become available.

The code may be of interest to people getting started with Flask, Beautiful Soup, AngularJS, or D3.js.
