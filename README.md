## Last Statement

This is a site which scrapes the last statements of people executed by the State of Texas from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website.

On the front page, all it does is show one such statement made by a person whose execution anniversary is today (or, if that is not possible, the nearest applicable day).

On the [sentiments page](http://laststatement.org/sentiments), it shows a grid of 16 common sentiments found in the statements (e.g. Apologized to victimâ€™s family, Admitted guilt, Proclaimed innocence). By clicking sentiments, you can filter and view matching statements.

It also powers a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/LastStatementTx) which posts excerpts from the statements on the anniversary of the execution (up to four per day).

The code may be of interest to people getting started with Flask, Beautiful Soup, AngularJS, or D3.js.
