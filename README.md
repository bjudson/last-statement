## Last Statement

This is a simple site which scrapes the last statements of people executed by the State of Texas from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website.

On the front page, all it does is show one such statement made by a person whose execution anniversary is today (or, if that is not possible, the nearest applicable day).

On the [terms page](http://laststatement.org/terms), it shows a graph of concepts found in last statements. Each term in the chart can be clicked to show which other concepts occur alongside it in the corpus, as well as the full list of statements referencing that concept.

The code may be of interest to people getting started with Flask, Beautiful Soup, or Dimple / d3.js.
