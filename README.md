## Last Statement

This is a simple site which scrapes the last statements of people executed by the state of Texas from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website.

Currently, all it does is show one such statement made by a person whose execution anniversary is today (or, if that is not possible, the nearest applicable day).

The code may be of interest to people getting started with Flask or Beautiful Soup.

The plan is to develop a system to navigate the statements via linguistic collocation.
